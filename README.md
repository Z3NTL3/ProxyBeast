### Get Started

We are very happy because of your interest in ProxyBeast. This guide is dedicated
to help you setup Proxybeast. 

Do not worry, our software is easy to use, so we won't be covering usage tutorials here. You may find tutorials on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@z3ntl3wip) channel.


- ### Installation
    
    There are two possible ways to install our software. To build from scratch, using ``Go`` tools. Or to install from a packaged installer.

    #### Precompiled installers and or executables

    | Platform      | File | Type |
    | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Windows 10/11 (windows/amd64)      | [Installer](https://github.com/Z3NTL3/ProxyBeast/releases/download/v1.0.0/ProxyBeast-amd64-installer.exe)       | Windows installer |

    > Installers and or bins for other platforms aren't available, you can build from scratch
    > or await upon completion of the WASM (web) variant of ProxyBeast

    #### Build from scratch

    We assume you already have Go and it's toolchains installed. If not, follow the steps on this article.
    > [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/installhttps://go.dev/doc/install)

    ##### Clone this repository
    We use GIT to clone this repo. This should download ProxyBeast in the current working folder. 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Z3NTL3/ProxyBeast
    ```

    ##### Navigate into ProxyBeast workspace
    In the previous step we did install ProxyBeast. Now let's navigate into the workspace folder.
    ```
    cd ProxyBeast
    ```

    ### Building
    
    For building, it is essential to first install all dependencies. To do so, execute the following.
    > We assume that you are located in the ProxyBeast workspace, as of the previous step.
    ```
    go get .
    ```

    - ##### Installating required tools
    First we need to install Wails. For this execute the following command.
    ```
    go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest
    ```
    > - **Important note**<br>
    > You require to have NPM installed. Which fits with Node.js. To install follow given directions here
    > [Install](https://nodejs.org/en)

    - ##### Validating tools
    To validate that you're all set, execute the following command. If everything seems OK, go further with the last procedures.
    ```
    wails doctor
    ```
    - ##### Final step 
    To build a binary (generating executables from source) execute the following:
    ```
    wails build
    ```
    > **NOTE**<br>
    > If you want to build an executable with GUI and a terminal for logs, execute the following command instead:
    > ```
    > wails build -windowsconsole
    >```
    > Console attached to build is only available on Windows

<br>

> [!WARNING]
> Currently we do only support a packaged installer for Windows.<br>
> Currently installers for MacOS and debain based linux distributions aren't supported.

* #### What do you mean with "zero dependency"
    With zero-dependency, we mean that ProxyBeast is ported together with a low level module for all of it's networking requirements. Which is a native module and uses zero third party dependency.
    
    > **Proxifier**<br>
    A module/library that is especially written to be ported with ProxyBeast, built by our the ProxyBeast authors.<br>
